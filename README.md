# Color Palette Picker

The color palette picker is a feature that allows users to select a color in three different input fields. It works by providing a visual interface where users can click on a color swatch to choose their desired color. The selected colors are then saved in the application as different color pallets that the user can then reference later and copy their corresponding hex-code for use in there own projects.

## How It Works

1. **Display Color Options**: The picker displays a list of color swatches, each representing a different color from the palette.
2. **User Interaction**: Users can click on any of the color swatches to select a color.
3. **Color Selection**: When a color swatch is clicked, the picker captures the selected color value.
4. **Save Color**: The selected color value is then saved to a pallet where all the information is saved along with the colors hex-code.
